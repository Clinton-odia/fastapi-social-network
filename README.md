# FastAPI Social Network API

A production-ready social networking backend built with **FastAPI**, featuring user authentication, posts, comments, likes/upvotes, and secure password hashing with **bcrypt/passlib**.  

This project was designed as a portfolio-ready application to demonstrate backend engineering, API design, and database modeling with modern Python frameworks. It follows clean architecture principles and includes essential functionality expected in a real-world social platform.
